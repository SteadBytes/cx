CX: Privacy-compatible distributed contact tracing
==================================================

![Build documentation](https://github.com/ipxe/cx/workflows/Build%20documentation/badge.svg)

CX is an architecture for privacy-compatible distributed contact
tracing, designed for use in pandemics such as Covid-19.

The CX architecture allows for retroactive identification of
potentially hazardous proximity contacts while providing strong
privacy guarantees.  No location data is ever shared with other users
or with any third party such as a government body.

For more information, see the [architecture
specification](https://github.com/ipxe/cx/releases/latest/download/cx.pdf).
